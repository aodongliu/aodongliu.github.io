Hi, Iâ€™m **Aodong Liu**, a PhD candidate in theoretical chemistry at the University of Washington.  
My work focuses on **large-scale electronic structure theory** and **quantum dynamics**â€”designing scalable algorithms that run efficiently on modern supercomputers. Iâ€™m also an active developer for **Gaussian**, one of the most widely used quantum chemistry software packages.  

On this site Iâ€™ll share a mix of things that matter to me:

- **Research & Development** â€” insights from building distributed algorithms for quantum chemistry, high-performance computing with MPI/OpenMP, and new methods for quantum proton simulations.  
- **Writing & Notes** â€” technical deep-dives, project updates, and reflections on my journey as a computational scientist.  
- **Personal** â€” sometimes about training, fitness, or just things I find inspiring.  

This site is still under construction, but it will grow as I document my projects and ideas.  

Stay tuned ðŸš€
