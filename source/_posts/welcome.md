Hi, I’m **Aodong Liu**, a PhD candidate in theoretical chemistry at the University of Washington. You can learn more about what I do [here](/about)


This is my personal blog. On this site I’ll share a mix of things that matter to me:

- **Research Notes**: Technical deep-dives, quantum chemistry tutorials, and reflections on my journey as a computational scientist. 
- **Stranger Stats**: I'm fascinated by sports statistics (though I'm not a data scientist by training), so I occasionally share fun and unexpected findings in <a href='/strangerStats/' style='font-weight: 600; color: #337ab7;'>Stranger Stats</a>.
- **Personal**: Sometimes about training, fitness, or just things I find inspiring.  

This site is still under construction, but it will grow as I document my projects and ideas.  

Stay tuned 🚀
