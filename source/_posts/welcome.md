Hi, I’m **Aodong Liu**, a PhD candidate in theoretical chemistry at the University of Washington.  
My work focuses on **large-scale electronic structure theory** and **quantum dynamics**. My research focuses on developing scalable algorithms for large-scale electronic structure theory and quantum dynamics that can efficiently run on modern supercomputers.


This is my personal blog. On this site I’ll share a mix of things that matter to me:

- **Research Notes**: technical deep-dives, quantum chemistry tutorials, and reflections on my journey as a computational scientist. 
- **Stanger Stats**: I'm fascinated by sports statistics (though I'm not a data scientist by training), so I occasionally share fun and unexpected findings in <a href='/strangerStats/' style='font-weight: 600; color: #337ab7;'>Stranger Stats</a>.
- **Personal**: sometimes about training, fitness, or just things I find inspiring.  

This site is still under construction, but it will grow as I document my projects and ideas.  

Stay tuned 🚀
