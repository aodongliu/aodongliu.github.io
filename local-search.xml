    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Aodong Liu</strong>, a PhD candidate in theoretical chemistry at the University of Washington.<br>My work focuses on <strong>large-scale electronic structure theory</strong> and <strong>quantum dynamics</strong>â€”designing scalable algorithms that run efficiently on modern supercomputers. Iâ€™m also an active developer for <strong>Gaussian</strong>, one of the most widely used quantum chemistry software packages.</p><p>On this site Iâ€™ll share a mix of things that matter to me:</p><ul><li><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong> â€” insights from building distributed algorithms for quantum chemistry, high-performance computing with MPI/OpenMP, and new methods for quantum proton simulations.</li><li><strong>Writing &amp; Notes</strong> â€” technical deep-dives, project updates, and reflections on my journey as a computational scientist.</li><li><strong>Personal</strong> â€” sometimes about training, fitness, or just things I find inspiring.</li></ul><p>This site is still under construction, but it will grow as I document my projects and ideas.</p><p>Stay tuned ðŸš€</p>]]></content>
